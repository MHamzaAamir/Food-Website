# Food-Website
This is a food ordering and delivery website that connects customers with local restaurants and facilitates the delivery of their orders. The website will have two main interfaces: a customer interface and a rider interface. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process of ordering food and ensures efficient delivery to customers.

Customer Interface Features:

User Registration: Customers can create an account by providing their basic information such as name, email address, and contact details.
Restaurant Listings: Customers can browse through a list of restaurants in their area, view menus, and access restaurant details including ratings and reviews.
Menu Selection: Customers can select items from the menu, customize their orders (e.g., toppings, special requests), and add them to their cart.
Cart Management: Customers can review their orders, modify quantities, and remove items before proceeding to checkout.
Order Placement: Customers can securely place their orders, select their preferred payment method, and specify their delivery address.
Rider Registration: Riders can create accounts by submitting their personal details, contact information, and vehicle information if applicable.
Order Assignment: Riders can receive order notifications, review order details, and accept or reject delivery requests based on their availability.
Navigation and Directions: Riders should have access to a built-in navigation system or map to help them reach the restaurant and the customer's delivery location efficiently.
Order Status Update: Riders can update the order status (e.g., arrived at restaurant, en route, delivered) to keep customers informed about the progress.
